// Herds in the exploration state wander freely within their environment, looking for grazeable terrain from their surroundings.
// Optimal performance is evaluated by the success in forming long chains of routes with viable grazing areas along the route.
// Boundaries of some superstructure such as a fence enclosure or, say, a grassland biome between a desert and an ocean are not yet known.
// Exploration behavior state is supposed to resemble most LÃ©vy flight.
