	If one of these three behavioral patterns is not implemented, the probability for transitioning into them will just always be 0.
	The actual underlying logic of Herd, Flock and School models will be kept as hard coded, but
	the utilities and probabilities can be weighted depending on the mob (or rather, the RL agent) in question.
